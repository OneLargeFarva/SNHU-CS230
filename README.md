Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

    Draw it or Lose it is an android based game developed by The Game Room. The current design allows for players to play against each other competing to guess an image that is being rendered over 30 seconds. 
    The Game Room has asked Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to design and integrate their game onto multiple platforms to include desktop (iOS, Windows) and iPhone. 
    In meeting with The Game Room, requirements were established as: 
  -     Ability to have one or more teams 
  -     Ability to have multiple players on a team 
  -     Game and Team names must be unique 
  -     Only one instance of the game can be loaded into memory 
  -     Cross-platform compatibility between web, iOS, and Android. 
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 
  What was done particularly well in this design document was breaking down the aspects of the request holistically.  
  Being able to not just justify recommendations, but explain in detail the benefits of design decisions such as storage management and security.  
  A robust design document can cut down on production and engineering time extensively, and free up bandwidth from the Project Manager to focus on status updates, stakeholder engagement and other project related tasks.  
  Providing the what and how upfront ensures everyone understands the job. 
 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 
  Having a UML diagram and an understanding of the big picture allowed me to better understand where the code needed to go. Being able to identify methods and variables upfront without needing to add more to mid-design  
  created a very clear path to completion.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
  In the Evaluation section under development requirements, I would go into to better detail on client side browser applications. Understanding there are many default and OS specific browsers, it would benefit the document 
  to provide characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages to them.  
 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
  The users needs are everything. Without a pleasant user experience there is no application. Understanding what the vision of the game was critical in approaching the software design. By the client drawing a comparison to 
  an old TV show similar to the application, provided insight into the mechanics and rules they were trying to build with this application.  
 
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 
  Having a pseudo code, or UML really helped me understand what was needed and the scope of the project. I approached the code by first creating each class that was needed, then filled in each class with the required methods. This  
  allowed me to see the structure of the code as it was being written. Learning to code with errors was a hurdle I had to overcome, because I immediately want to fix the error, even if I know two steps down the road they will resolve 
  themselves.
